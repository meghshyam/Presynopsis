\chapter*{Abstract}
The necessity for flying device with greater maneuverability and hovering
ability led to creation of a quadcopter.  Due to their ability to go to
inaccessible areas e.g., terraces of high rise buildings, hills, etc. and
capturing high quality images from onboard camera, it is indispensable in
different applications (e.g., search and rescue,  surveillance etc.).
Areas such as agriculture(for pest control), public health (stacked garbage
detection), civil inspection (dams, nuclear reactors, old temple restoration)
have opened a lot of opportunities towards utility of quadcopters.

Applications such as inspection of towers as well as art galleries require autonomous
imaging of multiplanar scene to provide the unrolled view of the scene. One of
the useful representation is a full panoramic view of the scenario. We cannot image large
multiplanar surfaces with the help of single quadcopter due to battery constraints. Here, the necessity
of using multiple quadcopters arises. The collaboration between these quadcopters can be
achieved by tracking each of them. Fiducials come to our rescue in case of tracking. However,
jerky nature of inexpensive quadcopters introduces motion blur. Hence, motion blur resilient fiducials
are of importance in such case.

Consider we would like to get an orthographic panoramic view of large multiplanar surface for precise details.
Imaging such angular surfaces need autonomous navigation of quadcopter. Mosaicing of multiplanar scenes
to get unrolled closeup view pose a challenge to homography based stitching methods. Even mosaicing of scenes
containing vacant spaces or featureless regions on single planar surface is not possible with present state of the art
stitching methods.
