\label{ch:quadcopter}
In this chapter we will familiarize with quadcopter, its components and
technical specifications. We will also discuss the prior work related to
mainly three areas: control and navigation of quadcopter, mosaicing and
fidiucials. 
\section{Quadcopter Specifications}
The necessity for flying device with greater maneuverability and hovering
ability led to creation of Quadcopter. A quadrocopter or quadcopter  is a
multirotor helicopter that is lifted and propelled by four rotors. The
four-rotor design allows quadcopters to be relatively simple in design yet
highly reliable and maneuverable. Quadcopter  is a  symmetrical vehicle which
has four rods with propellers connected to rotors  at each end. Two diagonally
opposite propellers rotate in clockwise direction while remaining  two rotate
in anticlockwise direction. 

The speed of each rotor can be independently varied
to achieve various controls. For example, if we would like to hover the
quadcopter , the thrust generated by all rotors should match the weight of the
quadcopter.
